# Neural Analytic Algorithm

## Introduction
Neural Analytic Algorithm (NAA) is a set of tools that is designed for "analytic" and "visualization". Beacuse we don't know what Matlab's operation or other nonopen-code tool, we build our toolbox.

## Install
Python is a widely used language. So we build a set of python-function. 
Just copy and paste at the folder same as you python code.

For example, I want use 'car'

```python
from .car import car
.
.
.
```
